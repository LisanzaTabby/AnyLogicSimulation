# AnyLogicSimulation
An IT Support Center for Customers 

# Objectives

The main objective of this activity was to create a simulation model of an IT Support Center using the Any Logic application. To demonstrate the behavior of customers entering the support center, queuing if any of the two technicians/service providers at the support center are busy attending to other customers and exiting the support center once they have been served. The metrics to keep track of are the average waiting time of customers while at the queue, average service time for each customer and the total number of customers served by the two technicians in one hour of simulation. In addition, a comparison was made in terms of the metrics, that is when there was one technician at the support center and while there were two technicians at the support center.

Real Time Number of Customers Served
After one hour of simulation the total number of customers served by the two technicians was 13 customers as per the run window show below in anylogic.

# Conclusion

The Any Logic simulation Application successfully modelled the IT Support center  as per the instructions with Graphical representation of the average waiting times of customers at the queue, real time count of customers being served by the technician and the queue length and the average service Time for each customer and with the comparisons when one technician is serving.
